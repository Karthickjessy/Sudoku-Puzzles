The objective of this group statistical report is to analyse the experimental Sudoku Puzzles dataset collected from an experiment conducted in Maynooth University compiled from 2009 to 2013.The dataset contains four types of Sudoku puzzles and the time associated to complete it. A correctly completed Sudoku puzzle will contain all six characters in each row, each column and each box of six cells. Sudoku puzzles are typically a 9 x 9 grid but here mini Sudoku puzzles, with a 6 x 6 grid, are used so that the puzzles can be completed in a short timeframe. The types of Sudoku puzzles differ only in the character required to be filled into each grid.

The types are:
Numbers
Letters
Greek Letters
Symbols
Three hypotheses tests has been carried out based on the dataset. The first hypotheses is to check how the type of Sudoku effects in completing the Sudoku successfully. The second hypotheses is to check how having previous experience of playing Sudoku impacts in successful completion of the puzzles. The third hypotheses is to check if there is any statistical difference in median survival time between the different levels of Sudoku using Survivial Analysis.
